      <description>I am a Masters student in Computing Science and a Research Assistant in Machine Learning and Medical Imaging at the Medical Image Analysis Laboratory (MIAL) under Prof. Ghassan Hamarneh at Simon Fraser University. I received a full scholarship to pursue my masters degree at SFU along with a special entrance scholarship. I later became an NSERC-CREATE Bioinformatics Fellow for the year 2018-2019 under the joint Bioinformatics Program between UBC-SFU.
My main interests lie in machine learning and deep learning, specifically for application towards medical imaging [1], [2], [3], computer vision [4], and natural language processing [5], [6].</description>
