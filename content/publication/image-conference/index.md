abstract: Image denoising is the first preprocessing step dealing with image processing. In image denoising an image is processed using certain restoration techniques to remove induced noise which may creep in the image during acquisition, transmission or compression process. Examples of noise in an image can be Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), Impulse Noise, etc. The goal of restoration techniques is to obtain an image that is as close to the original input image as possible. In this paper objective evaluation methods are used to judge the efficiency of different types of spatial domain filters applied to different noise models, with a quantitative approach. Performance of each filter is compared as they are applied on images affected by a wide variety of noise models. Conclusions are drawn in the end, about which filter is best suited for a number of noise models individually induced in an image, according to the experimental data obtained.
