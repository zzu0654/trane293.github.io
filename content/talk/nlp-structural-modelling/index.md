title: "[Paper Presentation] Natural Language Processing in Text Mining for Structural Modeling of Protien Complexes"
event: Science Talk at MBB 659 Special Topics in Bioinformatics
event_url: "http://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2018/fall/mbb/659/g100"
location: BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC Canada
summary: Presenting a highly scientific paper in a way that high school students can understand. The paper is a state-of-art method that uses natural language processing based approach towards structural modelling of proteins.
abstract: "Natural language processing have been widely used in bioinformatics, and one of the important use cases is to perform structural modelling in protein complexes. The challenge in this talk was to make it accessible to a high-school level audience. This involves not using jargon words without proper explanation, keeping the level of talk at a high level, and trying to induce interest in the audience to take up science as a career."
