title: "[Paper Presentation] SIMBICON and GENBICON: Physics Based Control Models for Locomotion"
event: CMPT 888 Computer Animation
event_url: "http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~kkyin/cmpt888/index.html"
location: Burnaby, BC Canada
summary: I present the two seminal models of physics-based walking, called SIMBICON and GENBICON. The course instructor KangKang Yin is the inventor of SIMBICON.
abstract: "The presentation surveys two seminal methods which were proposed for fluid physics-based animation for walking in bipeds and quadrupleds. The methods described are [SIMBICON](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/papers/Simbicon.htm) and [GENBICON](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/papers/2010-TOG-gbwc/index.html). "
