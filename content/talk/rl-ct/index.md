title: "[Paper Presentation] Multi-Scale Deep Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time 3D-Landmark Detection in CT Scans"
event: CMPT 880 Medical Imaging Meets Machine Learning
event_url: "http://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2018/fall/cmpt/880/g100"
location: Burnaby, BC Canada
summary: In this talk I present the first known application of reinforcement learning agents for landmark detection in CT Scans in medical imaging.
abstract: "The presentation starts with a brief tutorial about reinforcement learning, and learning agents in the context of Atari games. Later I transition to presenting the method and how it's applied to landmark detection in CT Scans. The paper is from Siemens, and they show that they achieve 0% failure rate on detecting landmarks (organs) in a 3D CT scan. This was the first of its kind application of RL in medical imaging."
