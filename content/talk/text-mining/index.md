location: BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC Canada
summary: Literature survey on the uses of text mining and natural language processing methods in bioinformatics.
abstract: "Text mining and natural language processing are the subfields of computer science which have found a variety of uses in many different areas, one of which is bioinformatics. In this talk, I discuss how TM/NLP based method have been used for unsupervised indexing of literature, finding protein-protein interactions, biomedical entity tagging, and sequence alignment in DNA and RNA."
