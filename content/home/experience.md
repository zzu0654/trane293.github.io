  * Leading a team of developers for the software development efforts towards a revolutionary new electronic health record (EHR) system which leverages advanced natural language processing and document parsing technologies.

  Responsibilities include:

  * Working closely with the CEO Dr. Roberta Lee in identifying current problems in existing EHR systems, and brainstorming solutions for the same.
  * Leading a group of consultants in their work in front-end development, database creation and API design.
  * Implementing critical NLP/Document Parsing APIs on the backend using the Python/Flask framework that implements business logic.

  * Working under the supervision of [Prof. Ghassan Hamarneh](https://sites.google.com/view/hamarneh-research/ghassans-bio?) in projects that broadly perform analysis on brain MRI scans from tumor patients.
  * Implemented a number of state-of-art segmentation algorithms for segmenting tumor structures in brain MRI scans. Wrote a complete modular framework from scratch that supports plug-and-play model definitions, image augmentation, multi-gpu training support and many other features. Link to open source framework: https://github.com/trane293/brats2017-proj/
  * Collaborated with lab members, and members from [Siemens Healthnieers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-us/) for a project, where I contributed in inception of idea, and implemented the proposed idea independently in Python/Tensorflow. Link to manuscript:  https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05181
  * Collaborated with the Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (nanometer scale microscopy) group in a project that beats the state-of-art in determining proper region of interests of excitation compared to noise. Manuscript under preparation.

  Personal project:

  * Undertook a personal project independently for dealing with the problem of missing MR pulse sequences (missing input) when state-of-art segmentation models are deployed in clinical setting.
  * Developed a novel, state-of-art, multi-modal generative adversarial network (GAN) that synthesizes multiple missing MR pulse sequences in a single forward pass by utilizing information from any number of available sequences. The synthesizes sequences can then be used as input to any downstream analysis pipeline (segmentation/classification). The method is the first multi-modal GAN to be used in practice in MR pulse sequence synthesis, and outperforms all the previous state-of-art methods. Link to manuscript: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12200 which is currently under review at a highly reputed journal in medical imaging.
  * Researched and presented state-of-art in brain tumor segmentation, generative adversarial networks, and image reconstruction throughout my tenure at MIAL.

  description = """
  * Working together with two peers from Stanford/Caltech towards developing a computer aided detection/diagnosis system for mammography (breast X-Rays) using state-of-art machine learning and deep learning models.
  * Developed the data processing pipeline from scratch in Python, that handles data coming from a clinic's PACS system and converts it to a format that allows effective analysis.
  * Researchers, designed, implemented and tested various classical machine learning as well as state-of-art deep learning methods for detection of abnormalities in mammography images.
  * Implemented various convolutional neural networks architectures ranging from autoencoders, siamese networks and FCNNs using Python/Keras/Tensorflow stack.
  * Implemented classic machine learning based pipeline that extracts shape/textural/contrast features from image ROIs, performs feature selection, trains random forest/SVM classifiers and validates the classifiers using a held-out test set.
  * Developed pipelines to visualize network predictions, activation maps, feature spread (using t-SNE).
  * Interviewed multiple candidates for the role of Machine Learning Engineer at the company, where the candidates ranged from advanced undergraduates to graduate students from top universities in USA.
