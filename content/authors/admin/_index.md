Anmol is masters student and a graduate research assistant at the [Medical Image Analysis Laboratory (MIAL)](http://medicalimageanalysis.com) under [Prof. Ghassan Hamarneh](https://sites.google.com/view/hamarneh-research/ghassans-bio?authuser=0) at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/). He received a full scholarship to pursue his masters degree at SFU along with a special entrance scholarship. He later became an [NSERC-CREATE Bioinformatics Fellow](https://bcbioinformaticsgrad.ca/) for the year 2018-2019 under the joint Bioinformatics Program between UBC-SFU. His main research interests lie at the intersection of AI and medicine, specifically the application of machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning methods towards medical image analysis (specifically brain MRI scans) and clinical text processing (NLP). Anmol has hands on experience with a variety of different projects in both academia and industry ranging from developing vision systems for autonomous cars, medical image analysis, natural language processing, computer animation and reinforcement learning. Currently he is a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Division of Neuroscience at Vancouver General Hospital](https://neuroscience.centreforbrainhealth.ca/). Apart from that, he is also working part-time as a Consulting Software Engineer for [Pluto Health Innovations](https://www.corporationwiki.com/p/31mua9/pluto-health-innovations-inc) to develop smart electronic health records (EHR) system for clinics by leveraging advances in natural language processing.

Before joining SFU for his masters, Anmol worked at [RadSupport Inc.](https://youtu.be/wHSxFcKBAOs?t=290) as a Machine Learning Engineer alongside Stanford/Caltech alumni. He did his undergrad at [DAV Institute of Engineering and Technology](http://www.davietjal.org/) in Jalandhar, and received the [INAE Mentoring of Engineering Students Fellowship](https://www.inae.in/mentoring-of-engineering-students-by-inae-fellows/) to pursue undergraduate dissertation under [Prof. Sushmita Mitra](https://www.isical.ac.in/~sushmita/) and [Dr. B. Uma Shankar](https://www.isical.ac.in/~uma/) at [ISI Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/). He has had the privilege to be mentored by [Dr. Jayasree Chakraborty](http://hpbresearch.org/members/jayasree-chakraborty/) and [Dr. Abhishek Midya](http://hpbresearch.org/members/abhishek-midya/) from early in his undergad, which essentially lead him to where he is today.
